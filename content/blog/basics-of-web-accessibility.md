I've been reading the book [Accessibility for Everyone](https://abookapart.com/products/accessibility-for-everyone), which discusses accessibility on the web.
A common critique of accessibility &mdash; not just for the web &mdash; is that it takes too much effort for too little reward.
You could argue that we can't design the world for the exception, especially if it's to the detriment of the general public.

But what if that's not always true?
What if designing for the exception can also improve the experience for the regular?

That concept is called *universal design*.
Universal design aims to make life better for the **most** amount of people.
Even "regular" people can benefit from accessible design.

## Common struggles

There are many kinds of disabilities that can make browsing the web a difficult experience.
The most common ones however, are disabilities related to:

- Eyesight
- Motor function
- Cognition

Apart from disabilities, people also have differing environmental circumstances.
Some people &mdash; or actually, *most* people &mdash; only use a mobile phone for browsing the web (yikes).
That's why 'mobile first' design is important.

Internet connection speeds also vary wildly across the globe.
So make sure your website's experience also works well for those with a slow connection.

## Financial benefits

Money?
Is accessible design good for money?

Maybe.
And maybe even **probably**.
Hear me out.

You will have a wider audience.
More people than you would think struggle with browsing the web.
Remember old people?
An increasing amount of old people are using the web, and most of them have one or more of the 'common struggles'.
Apart from that, you would be surprised by the amount of 'not so old' people struggling with the web.

You're websites will be more pleasant for **everyone** by making them more accessible.
And as it turns out, making your website more accessible, also improves 'Search Engine Optimisation' (SEO).
Making your website easier to find.
(Also for potential new customers.)

## Testing

To make sure your website is accessible to most people, you should do some testing.
Optimally, you would be able to test on real users with all kinds of different disabilities.
In realilty, this won't be possible for most projects.

Make sure you at least test your website on many different devices and connection speeds.
And try to adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WGAG).

## Accessible content

Let's get practical.
In theory, it's not that hard to make an accessible website.
You should make sure that everything on your website is:

- Easy to see
- Easy to hear
- Easy to interact with
- Easy to understand

In practice though, following these guidelines is pretty hard.

### Easy to see

Typography and contrast are the most important factors.
Regarding typography, make sure you use a font that's easy to read, at least for the body copy.
Apply a good font size, line height and create proper hierarchy between headings and paragraphs.

Typography is a huge topic and I'm not even close to being an expert.
To learn more, I highly recommend [Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com/) by Matthew Butterick.
I've certainly learned a lot from it.

Apart from typography: contrast and whitespace.
Give all the elements on your website space to breathe.
And make sure your colors are high in contrast.
If in doubt, always go for more contrast.

For body copy, (very) dark grey works well on a white background.
For headings you can play around more with different colors.
Bigger text &mdash; and especially with a higher font weight &mdash; provide more contrast already.

Oh and **links should look like links**.

### Easy to hear

This is mostly about screen reader accessibility.
To make your site easy to hear, provide detailed descriptions for pictures and infographics.

Also, write semantically correct HTML.
Use headings for meaning, not for styling (in your HTML files).
Use labels with forms.

### Easy to interact with

Keep your site very simple and as logical as possible.
Give buttons (and maybe even links) enough padding to make them easy to click.
Always make it easy for your visitor to understand where they are on your site.
Have the current page highlighted in your navigations bar for example.

But most importantly, don't be cute.
Use a standard navigation bar in your header and in your footer.
And if your website asks for it, provide breadcrumbs.

### Easy to understand

Write in plain language, especially on more formal websites.
If you're writing your own blog, you'll likely want to write more creatively.
That's perfectly fine, for the blogposts themselves.
Keep the rest of your website conventional.
