The web is becoming more **unusable** every year and there is no sign of stopping.
It's filled to the brim with advertisements, trackers and unoptimized **everything**.
Noone gives a crap about efficiency, (true) simplicity or accessibility.
Everything is owned by big corporations, and all *they* want is your **data** and your **attention**.
The purpose of these corporations seems to be to get as many people as addicted to the web as possible.
And I think they're succeeding...

## The resistance

Thankfully, I'm not the only one feeling this way.
There are many smart people working on better alternatives.
There are personal websites **without** advertisements and trackers.
There are tools to make surfing the web valuable **and** enjoyable.
But: 
- It takes more effort (to find or set up)
- It generally *looks* worse
- And it might not have everything you need (yet)
